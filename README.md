# Submission for the 30th Jame Gam

This project is a submission for the 30th [Jame Gam](https://itch.io/jam/jame-gam-30) game jam. The game is a 2D puzzle solver where the player arranges
various gears on the level to connect the power sources to the consumers who have
a limited amount stored energy (the player health) to be without power.

The inspiration for the main gameplay loop is from [Mini-Metro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/287980/Mini_Metro).
